	// This option has no explicit value by default, but it is recommended to set one if the target database is known
	// in advance. This has the benefit of ensuring a consistent target database name throughout the session in a
	// straightforward way and potentially simplifies driver logic as well as reduces network communication resulting
	// in better performance.
	// When no explicit name is set, the driver behavior depends on the connection URI scheme supplied to the driver on
	// instantiation and Bolt protocol version.
	//
	// Specifically, the following applies:
	//
	// - for bolt schemes
	//		queries are dispatched to the server for execution without explicit database name supplied,
	// 		meaning that the target database name for query execution is determined by the server.
	//		It is important to note that the target database may change (even within the same session), for instance if the
	//		user's home database is changed on the server.
	//
	// - for neo4j schemes
	//		providing that Bolt protocol version 4.4, which was introduced with Neo4j server 4.4, or above
	//		is available, the driver fetches the user's home database name from the server on first query execution
	//		within the session and uses the fetched database name explicitly for all queries executed within the session.
	//		This ensures that the database name remains consistent within the given session. For instance, if the user's
	//		home database name is 'movies' and the server supplies it to the driver upon database name fetching for the
	//		session, all queries within that session are executed with the explicit database name 'movies' supplied.
	//		Any change to the userâ€™s home database is reflected only in sessions created after such change takes effect.
	//		This behavior requires additional network communication.
	//		In clustered environments, it is strongly recommended to avoid a single point of failure.
	//		For instance, by ensuring that the connection URI resolves to multiple endpoints.
	//		For older Bolt protocol versions, the behavior is the same as described for the bolt schemes above.
